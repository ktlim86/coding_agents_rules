assistant: "I'll design and optimize a portfolio using modern portfolio theory and our quant strategies. Let me use the quant-portfolio-manager agent to create an efficient portfolio allocation."
<commentary>
Portfolio construction requires expertise in optimization, risk management, and strategy integration.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Asset allocation optimization
user: "Our portfolio allocation needs to be rebalanced for better risk-adjusted returns"
assistant: "I'll analyze the current allocation and optimize for better risk-adjusted returns. Let me use the quant-portfolio-manager agent to implement optimal asset allocation strategies."
<commentary>
Asset allocation optimization requires understanding of risk-return relationships and portfolio theory.
