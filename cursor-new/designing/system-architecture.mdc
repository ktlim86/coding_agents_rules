# System Architecture Design

## Purpose
Design scalable, maintainable, and secure system architecture that supports MVP requirements while allowing for future growth and evolution.

## Architecture Principles

### MVP-Focused Design
- **Simplicity First**: Start with the simplest architecture that meets requirements
- **Incremental Complexity**: Add complexity only when justified by requirements
- **Core Functionality**: Focus on essential features and capabilities
- **Future-Proofing**: Design for extensibility without over-engineering
- **Risk Mitigation**: Address high-risk architectural decisions early

### Software Engineering Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Components are replaceable with compatible alternatives
- **Interface Segregation**: Components depend only on interfaces they use
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Quality Attributes
- **Scalability**: System can handle increased load and data
- **Performance**: Meets response time and throughput requirements
- **Reliability**: System operates correctly under various conditions
- **Security**: Protects data and system integrity
- **Maintainability**: Easy to modify and extend
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
