# Retrospectives and Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Conduct regular retrospectives to evaluate team performance, identify improvement opportunities, and implement continuous improvement practices for MVP development.

## Retrospective Principles

### Continuous Improvement Focus
- **Regular Reflection**: Regular evaluation of processes and outcomes
- **Action-Oriented**: Focus on actionable improvements
- **Team Collaboration**: Involve all team members in improvement process
- **Data-Driven**: Use metrics and evidence to guide improvements
- **Incremental Change**: Implement small, manageable improvements

### Retrospective Types
- **Sprint Retrospectives**: End-of-sprint team reflection
- **Release Retrospectives**: Post-release evaluation
- **Project Retrospectives**: End-of-project comprehensive review
- **Incident Retrospectives**: Post-incident analysis and learning
- **Process Retrospectives**: Regular process improvement sessions

## Retrospective Framework

### The 5 Whys
- **Purpose**: Root cause analysis for problems
- **Process**: Ask "why" five times to get to root cause
- **Example**:
  1. Why did the deployment fail? (Because the tests failed)
  2. Why did the tests fail? (Because the database was down)
  3. Why was the database down? (Because the connection pool was exhausted)
  4. Why was the connection pool exhausted? (Because connections weren't being closed)
  5. Why weren't connections being closed? (Because we don't have proper connection management)

### Start, Stop, Continue
- **Start**: New practices to begin
- **Stop**: Practices to discontinue
- **Continue**: Practices to maintain
- **Benefits**: Simple, actionable format

### Mad, Sad, Glad
- **Mad**: What made us frustrated or angry
- **Sad**: What made us disappointed or concerned
- **Glad**: What made us happy or proud
- **Benefits**: Emotional perspective on team experience

### KALM (Keep, Add, Less, More)
- **Keep**: Practices to maintain
- **Add**: New practices to introduce
- **Less**: Practices to reduce
- **More**: Practices to increase
- **Benefits**: Balanced view of current practices
