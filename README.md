# How to use

## For cursor rules
You can use cursor-old. Remember to go to project-admin.mdc and replace the conda [ENVIRONMENT_TO_BE_REPLACE] with the desired environment name. 

You can use cursor-new. Remember to go to master-rules.mdc and replace the conda [ENVIRONMENT_TO_BE_REPLACE] with the desired environment name.

After you manage to change, move the cursor rules to .cursor.

## Improvement
Sometimes you find that cursor will not be following instruction. You will need to ask cursor why the rules weren't followed and then ask for improvement to the rules and see if after introducing new rules, does it improve. 

## For Claude

Move the claude to .claude in order to use.
